# Tool Grader Kanban Board

This file serves as a simple Markdown-based Kanban board for tracking project tasks. For a more interactive experience, please use the GitHub Projects interface.

## GitHub Projects Setup (Recommended)

To set up a proper Kanban board using GitHub Projects:

1. Go to the [tool-grader repository](https://github.com/norrisaftcc/tool-grader)
2. Click on the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Choose "Board" from the templates
5. Name the project "Tool Grader Development"
6. Click "Create"

Once created, set up the following columns:
- **Backlog**: Tasks that need to be done but aren't actively being worked on yet
- **Ready**: Tasks that are ready to be picked up
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on
- **Testing**: Tasks that are completed but need verification
- **Done**: Completed tasks

You can then populate the board with issues from the repository.
