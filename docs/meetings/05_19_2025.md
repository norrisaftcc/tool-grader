## Meeting Notes

### 1. Project Status Update (Marcus)

Marcus provided an overview of the current project status:
- Initial repository structure established
- Documentation organized from unsorted materials
- MVP demo with local folder-based grading implemented
- Sample assignments converted from existing CS course

### 2. Documentation Structure (Priya)

Priya reviewed the documentation organization:
- Architecture documents provide clear reasoning for container approach
- Setup guides for GitHub and Canvas integration are comprehensive
- Noted that the development guide needs expansion based on early testing

**Dr. Schmidt:** "The Canvas API documentation references are particularly helpful. I can see this saving hours of integration time."

### 3. MVP Demo Presentation (Marcus)

Marcus demonstrated the MVP implementation:
- Showed local folder-based grading without external integrations
- Ran grading on sample student submissions with varying levels of correctness
- Highlighted the detailed feedback generated in both markdown and JSON formats

**Dr. Norris:** "I'm impressed by how quickly the MVP came together. The feedback format is exactly what our students need - detailed but not overwhelming."

**Jamal:** "The Docker containerization will be straightforward to implement based on this structure. I can see clear security boundaries."

### 4. Sample Assignments Discussion (All)

The team reviewed the newly added sample assignments converted from CSC-134:

#### Assignment Value Assessment

**Apple Sales Assignment:**
- **Priya:** "This is an excellent starter assignment that tests basic input/output and calculations."
- **Sofia:** "From a student perspective, the clear expected output helps tremendously."
- **Value-add:** Good for first-week Python introductions, tests core concepts.

**Receipt Calculator Assignment:**
- **Dr. Schmidt:** "The focus on formatting currency values addresses a common pain point for new programmers."
- **Marcus:** "The function structure encourages modularity early in the learning process."
- **Value-add:** Tests precision in calculations and output formatting.

**Rectangle Comparison Assignment:**
- **Priya:** "This introduces conditional logic in a visual, intuitive way."
- **Sofia:** "The validation requirements are especially useful - students often forget to handle bad inputs."
- **Value-add:** Natural progression into more complex decision-making.

**Crate Calculator Assignment:**
- **Dr. Norris:** "This represents a realistic business application that students can relate to."
- **Jamal:** "The more complex calculation chain is a good test of the autograder's capabilities."
- **Value-add:** Combines multiple concepts, closer to real-world applications.

**Consensus:** The progression from simple to complex assignments provides an excellent testing suite for the grader while offering pedagogical value.

### 5. Next Steps and Action Items

1. **Marcus & Jamal:** Begin implementing Docker containerization for secure execution (Due: June 2)
2. **Dr. Schmidt:** Prepare Canvas API credentials for test integration (Due: May 26)
3. **Priya:** Develop three additional assignments focusing on loops and data structures (Due: June 9)
4. **Sofia:** Conduct initial student testing with the MVP on sample assignments (Due: June 9)
5. **Dr. Norris:** Review resource allocation for Phase 2 implementation (Due: May 30)

## Key Decisions

1. The MVP will be expanded to include containerization before adding external integrations
2. Sample assignments will be organized into a progressive curriculum path
3. Early student testing will begin with the current MVP to gather feedback
4. Documentation will remain a priority alongside implementation

## Next Meeting

**Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Focus:** Docker containerization review and Canvas API integration progress
